Data structure and algorithm with C. This repo is intended for recording my learning process and code about data structure and algorithm with C (or C++) .



## Data Structure 

- [x] List (Basic Definition & Operations)
  - [x]  Sequential List
  - [x]  Linked List
- [x] Stack  (Basic Definition & Operations)
  - [x]  Sequential Stack 
  - [x]  Linked stack
- [x] Queue (Basic Definition & Operations)
  - [x]  Sequential Queue
  - [x]  Linked Queue
- [x] Tree（BST）
  - [x] Basic Definition & Operations
  - [x] Traversal
  - [x] Common algorithm
